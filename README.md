More information can be found on the project's [website](https://github.com/cvandijck/azure-devops-tools).

## Installation

*Add information on how to install adopt.*

You can install adopt using the distributed wheel via pip:
```console
python -m pip install adopt-0.0.0-py3-non-any.whl
```

This installation should automatically pull and install all required dependencies from PyPI. In the case of custom 
dependencies, you can direct pip to a local server:

```console
python -m pip install adopt-0.0.0-py3-none-any.whl --find-links .\dependencies
```

## Getting Started

*Add information on the typical use of adopt, either as library or as a console script.*

Import the adopt library in python:
```python
import adopt
```

Display the help page of the console script:
```console
adopt -h
```

Execute the console script:
```console
adopt arg1 arg2 --optional_arg arg3
```
